## About
This project was developed for graduation subject (Programação para Dispositivos Móveis - PDM).
The application is a facilitator for dividing expenses among a group of people who share expenses on events, such as dinners or parties. It allows users to enter information about who participated, how much each person spent, and what they purchased. Additionally, it offers the functionality to remove participants, edit expense information, and automatically calculate how much each person should receive or pay to even out the bills. The application seeks to simplify the expense division process, providing a practical and efficient solution for the group.
